#### Homework 2. Iterators and decorators
### Describing
The script includes 5 tasks in the area of iterators and decorators.

### Preparation
For convenient utilizing this script I advise user to create virtual environment.

First of all, you should create virtual environment in acceptable directory (*iter_venv* is a name for example).
```
python3 -m venv iter_venv
```
Also you need activate this venv
```
source iter_venv/bin/activate
```

The second step is the installation of the modules. This can be done in the following way:
```
git clone https://github.com/Evgen01011/Python_BI_2022/homework_2_2
pip install -r ../Python_BI_2022/hw_2_2/requirements.txt
```

### Features
The script includes 5 tasks

**Tasks**

- `MyDict`: creation of special dictionary
- `iter_append` function: add elements in the end of iterator
- decorators of function of class
- `switch_privacy` decarator: exchange conditions of methods 
- `OpenFasta` context manager for reading fasts file
- brute force algorithms for hybridization
